The expression analyzer works just about perfectly except for the entrance of parenthesis.
I was unable to figure out how to create an algorithm to account for multiple parenthesis in a row and put them inOrder into a binary tree.
With that said, the expressionanalyzer still validates that the entered expression is correct, with the use of parenthesis, the only issue is with the output being incorrect.
The program does still run and does not crash with parenthesis involved.
