The CoffeeQueue has four queues displayed by both JProgressBars and JLabels. In order to add new customers into the queue, you press the spacebar.

The CoffeeQueue also removes customers at a 'random' rate as well. To see this you can continually press space bar and watch as the queue numbers go down.
In order to "wipe" the customers in queue, click and drag the mouse until the progress bars are empty. 

Customers enter each queue depending on which queue is the smallest so no queue gets overfilled while the others are low. This is for effeincy for the cafe.
